            We would be thrilled if you can join us. Chicago is easily
            accessible from nearly anywhere—fly into O'Hare (ORD) or Midway
            (MDW) and take public transit, taxi, or rideshare into the city.
            Within the city, getting around is simple with the CTA trains and
            buses connecting most neighborhoods. Taxis and rideshares are
            readily available, especially downtown. You won't need a rental car
            unless you're planning to travel far outside the city.

                  Most out-of-town visitors fly into one of two major airports:
                  O'Hare (ORD) or Midway (MDW).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>1. O'Hare International Airport (ORD)</strong> is
                  northwest of the city and serves many major airlines. It's
                  connected to downtown Chicago by the CTA Blue Line, which runs
                  24/7 and costs just $5 from the airport.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>2. Midway International Airport (MDW)</strong> is on
                  the southwest side of the city, closer to the University of
                  Chicago and Hyde Park. It's a hub for Southwest Airlines and
                  is connected to downtown via the CTA Orange Line.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both airports offer taxi, rideshare, and shuttle services, and
                  each is a reasonable option depending on your home airport and
                  airline. We recommend checking flights to both to find the
                  best schedule and fare.

                  There is so much to do! If you're coming from out-of-town, and
                  you have the weekend to spare, we highly recommend taking the
                  chance to explore. There are so many iconic landmarks,
                  charming neighborhoods, and fun museums.

                  Our venue in Evanston has a sister hotel

                    >The Gem Suites</a
                  >. It's a convenient choice right across the street from the
                  venue and with easy access to nearby restaurants. However,
                  keep in mind that it is fairly north of the city and can be a
                  far drive to anywhere south of downtown (~45 min to the
                  welcome party in Hyde Park). A more central option is to stay
                  downtown, especially if you plan to explore the city and you
                  like public transit. Otherwise, Chicago has plenty of hotels
                  and Airbnbs in Evanston, downtown, and other neighborhoods, so
                  you can choose based on your schedule, budget, and interests.

                  Chicago has great easy-to-use public transit, especially if
                  you will be downtown. The "L" (short for "elevated") train
                  system and CTA buses cover most of the city. You can pay for
                  trips using a Ventra card (or the Ventra app) or tap with your
                  credit card using contactless payment.

                    >The Chicago transit website</a
                  >
                  has many helpful maps to reference, including a "downtown
                  sightseeing by transit" map if you're planning to explore!
                  Walking is often the best way to explore neighborhoods, and
                  Divvy bikes or scooters are great for short trips. If you
                  prefer to travel by car or will be traveling further outside
                  of downtown (like to our venue in Evanston), rideshares like
                  Uber and Lyft are widely available, and taxis are generally
                  easy to find down town.

                  No, renting a car isn't necessary. Parking is expensive and
                  often hard to find, and traffic can be heavy. Public transit,
                  rideshares, and walking are more convenient for getting
                  around. However, if you strongly prefer driving, and you don't
                  plan to explore downtown, it would be OK to rent a car since
                  the parking situation is not bad north of the city near our
                  venue in Evanston.

                  The welcome party is at Seven Ten Social in Hyde Park, right
                  by the University of Chicago (1055 E 55th St). From downtown,
                  you can take the Metra Electric line south to 55th-56th-57th
                  for $3.75 (20-30 min) or the 6 CTA bus for $2.25 (40-50 min).
                  It is also pretty easy to get a Lyft or an Uber from anywhere.
                  If you have a car and are planning to drive, there is free
                  street parking along 55th street and all the nearby side
                  streets, though it can fill up so you might need to park a
                  block or two away. If you have Google Maps, you can click on
                  the map in the "Schedule" section above and it will give you

                  The venue is located in Evanston (1560 Oak Ave), north of
                  Chicago. I recommend driving or getting an Uber/Lyft. There
                  will be plenty of street parking if you have a car, and the
                  drive from downtown is 30-40 min depending on traffic. If you
                  want to take public transit, it is inconvenient (1.5+ hours)
                  but possible using the "L" (short for "elevated") train system
                  with a transfer to the purple line, which will take about 1.5
                  hours. If you have Google Maps, you can click on the map in
                  the "Schedule" section above and it will give you the
